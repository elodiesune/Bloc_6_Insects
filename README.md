# Projects Prep - Full Stack Data Science Projects


## Project Overview ü¶Å

**Duration: 4200 minutes**

Welcome to the final phase of the Data Science program! In this phase, you will be working on your Full Stack Data Science projects, which will be a testament to your newly acquired skills in Data Science. Let's take a closer look at what a successful project should encompass.

### Project Goal

Your project's primary objective is to research and manage a Data Science project from start to finish. The aim is to showcase the skills that make a good Data Scientist or Analyst. You'll need to identify an industry or field that motivates you, find relevant data sources, and devise a data-driven approach to deliver value to that sector or address one of their problems.

### How to Work on the Project?

The project you'll be undertaking will be more challenging and comprehensive than the exercises you've done so far. For this reason, you'll be working in teams, and no exceptions will be allowed. The exact number of teams may vary, typically ranging between 4 and 7, depending on the number of students in your session. The Jedha's staff will provide you with more details about team formation.

### Which Project to Choose?

Jedha has partnered with companies that offer projects for students to work on. If such opportunities are available, we strongly encourage you to take them as they provide a chance to test your skills on real-world problems and potentially open up career opportunities.

If external projects are not available, we recommend thinking about the sector or industry you'd like to work in and finding data that can help you solve the problems or create value in a data-driven manner. The process of finding relevant data may be challenging, but by the end of the program, you should be equipped with skills to scrape the web for data. Additionally, the provided [data sources](where_to_get_data.md) can be helpful.

### Deliverable

To successfully complete this project, you'll need to produce the following:

1. A slide deck that explains the steps and conclusions of your project. Be sure to focus on the following aspects:
   - The problem you are addressing
   - The type of data you are working with
   - The solution(s) you implemented
   - A demo of your final product
   - The potential real-world impact of your solution (this is appreciated by recruiters and non-technical audiences as it demonstrates your business acumen)
   - Ideas for future improvements and next steps to advance the project further

### Demoday

The project module will be brought to a close by the Demoday. It's a casual (but mandatory) public event where all the teams present their achievements. Each team member must speak at least 1 minute. The presentations have to be very concise (max. 6-7 minutes per team) and are meant to share your findings with a non-technical audience. Make sure your speech is understandable for non-experts. Feel free to invite your family and friends!

### What Makes a Project "Valid" for the Certificate?

At minimum, to achieve the project successfully, you need to:

- Explain the problem you are trying to solve, and what role can data science play in solving it.
- Show how you used the technologies you learned during the bootcamp to solve the problem.
- Include some detailed objectives, project management details such as timetable, tentative budget, in order to be able to pitch the project to potential users/clients/investors, and mention conformity with RGDP.
- Include some data analytics, machine learning, or deep learning, and show your results in some monitoring tool.
- Detail the data extraction and cleaning process, and some perspective on how to systematize and maintain it in the future.
- Show your understanding and leadership of the project end-to-end.

Again this is the minimum you should do. You can definitely do more, and we will appreciate that. However, it is definitely better to focus on the main features of your infrastructure to create something robust rather than creating an unreliable automation full of bugs.

### FAQ

**When should I start?** The sooner the better! Whenever you have a moment, try to tackle a bit of the project even though we haven't covered everything you need to know in the course.

- Defining what you're interested in
- Find appropriate data sources, or contact potential partners that would provide you with data

**What tools can I use?**

We're very open to the tools you can use. The easiest ones are:

- Powerpoint or Google Slide for your slide deck. You can follow Jedha's template that you can download in the resource section of this course.

**What if I can't finish the project?**

It's OK if you have not done everything you wanted, at a minimum:

- Get a Minimal Viable Product, or a Minimal Proof of Concept
- Explain how it could deliver value
- Present some improvement perspective

You will have some time after the boot camp ends to improve your project for it to be ready for certification.

**What if I fail?**

If you fail on your project for certification, you will be able to resubmit it once up to two months after the end of your cohort. If you fail again, you will need to follow another Full Stack program cohort.

### Tips

- Don't underestimate data preprocessing!
- Try to build a team with complementary profiles:
  - Someone could be good in scraping/exploratory analysis
  - Another one could be good at modeling
  - Another one could be good at deployment

Happy coding! üë©‚Äçüíª
